#After installing the plugin on your Lametric device enter in your account ID. This plugin will display the total amount of XLM in the account.  It will then display the USD value of that amount.  Afterwards will display the change in percentage in the Wallet (depending on if you received XLM(postive value) or you send some XLM(negative value)).
